# A.I. Arena

"Got a question for an AI and don't know which one to ask? Ask them all at once!"

This project is a **front-end and server prototype that lets you query multiple instances at once**.

## Here's how it works :

  1. You add your favourite A.I.s
  2. Save the settings
  3. Ask the question using the "Master Input"
  4. See what replies you get
  5. Choose the winner and keep the conversation going.

## Here's a video (of what it would be like) in action :

**Note:** The entire AI system is only an ideea as of yet - what you see is the front-end and a mockup back-end reply.

## Project Highlights

- **Front-end prototype:** Interactive layout for multiple AI instances
- **Server request handling:** Supports OpenAI, Claude, and DeepSeek APIs via API keys  
- **Settings modal:** Add/edit details, upload representational images, and set API keys  
- **Simultaneous querying:** Send the same prompt to multiple AI instances at once

## Future Work

- Add conversation history per AI  
- Enable richer multi-instance interactions  
- Support more AI models and custom prompts
